# netflix-data-visualization

Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of tv shows, movies, documentaries, and more other contents. You can watch as much as you want by subscribing. There's always something new to discover and new TV shows and movies are added every week!
I'm interested to analyze netflix dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows. I want to go deeper visualizing some points:
1. How content is distributed?
2. Which country is the highest number of movie and tv show?
3. How many content have added over years?
4. How the genre of content is distributed?
5. Which genre is most added in United States?
6. How is the rating distribution?
7. How many titles do have more than one directors?
8. Who is the most directed?
